### Source
The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. From 2005-2016, the SAT had three sections, each of which was worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.
